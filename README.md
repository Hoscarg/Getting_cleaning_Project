# Getting_cleaning_Project

The script run_analysis.R merges train and test data form Samsung data repository by binding both files. It extracts columns that refer to mean and std from measurements carried out in the experiment by searching for "mean" and "std" word particles in the "features" file, which contains the variable descriptive names. It labels with proper names the activity involved in each observation by establishing a correspondence between the data in y (an integer) and the "activity_labels" file. After all, it merges (actually binds columns) final  x and y data with proper descriptive labels in column names and activities.
It is done previously to the last part, an independent one. In the last part, variables are averaged for each activity and each subject in a new data set. It can be done efficiently through plyr lybrary and finally, output is written in an output textfile.
